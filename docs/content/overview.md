# Overview

A one-read map of the whole engine. The [explanation pages](../explanations/) expand each
topic; follow the links for the full account.

## Shape of a program

A client — the editor or a standalone app — fills an `AppConfig` and calls `se::run`,
which owns the window, renderer, UI, and main loop. Clients extend it by attaching
**layers**. A `Layer` is a struct of optional callbacks, the Go-interface pattern rather
than a virtual base class.

```cpp
auto config = se::AppConfig{ /* window */, .onCreate = ..., .onExit = ... };
return se::run(config);
```

See [the main loop](../explanations/app-lifecycle-and-window/main-loop-and-run/).

## One frame

`run` drives this sequence every frame. The back half does the substantive work: layers
record GPU work and add render-graph passes, then the renderer derives the barriers and
executes the frame.

```mermaid

    A[pollEvents] --> B[layer.onUpdate dt]
    B --> C{beginFrame ok?}
    C -- no, minimized/resize --> A
    C -- yes --> D[layer.onRender — submit GPU work]
    D --> E[layer.onUi]
    E --> F[beginFrameGraph — cull + scene passes]
    F --> G[layer.onRenderGraph — app adds passes]
    G --> H[endFrame — derive barriers, execute graph, present]
    H --> A
```

When the loop ends, `run` calls `waitGpuIdle` before any teardown, so no in-flight
command buffer still references a resource about to be freed. That ordering anchors the
engine's [resource ownership model](../explanations/core-and-conventions/).

## Render graph

Each pass **declares** what it does with each resource (`ColorWrite`, `SampledRead`,
`StorageImageRWCompute`, …) rather than writing barriers by hand. The graph turns those
declarations into the right `vk::ImageMemoryBarrier2` / `vk::MemoryBarrier2` and layout
transitions, then records each pass body inside its rendering scope.

Light culling, the scene pass, shadow passes, post-processing, and the present blit to the
swapchain are all declared passes over imported images. Start at the
[render graph overview](../explanations/frame-and-render-graph/render-graph-overview/).

## Modules

The engine is a DAG of C++26 named modules in one namespace, `se`: leaves at the bottom,
the app at the top.

```mermaid

    Core
    Signal --> Core
    Json --> Core
    Window --> Core
    Window --> Signal
    Geometry --> Core
    Scene --> Core
    Scene --> Json
    Rendering --> Core
    Rendering --> Window
    Rendering --> Geometry
    Assets --> Rendering
    Assets --> Scene
    Assets --> Geometry
    SceneEdit --> Scene
    SceneEdit --> Signal

    Control --> Rendering
    Control --> Assets
    App --> Rendering
    App --> Window
    Host --> App
    Host --> Control
    Host --> SceneEdit
```

`Rendering` carries a `:RenderGraph` partition; the larger modules split into an
interface partition plus several `.cpp` implementation units. The
[architecture section](../explanations/architecture-and-conventions/) covers the module
mechanics and the build.
