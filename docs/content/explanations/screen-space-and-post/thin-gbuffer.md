# G-buffer

The screen-space effects need to know, per pixel, what surface is there and how it faces the camera.
The engine is forward-shaded, so there's no fat G-buffer to read. A small prepass writes just enough
geometry instead: the view-space normal and view-space depth, packed into one `rgba16f` target. That
single image feeds GTAO, contact shadows, and SSGI.

## How it works

The prepass renders the instanced scene the same way the depth pre-pass does, but its fragment shader
writes the geometry buffer rather than only laying down depth. The push constant carries `viewProj`
(world → clip, for `SV_Position`) and `view` (world → view). The vertex stage transforms the normal
into view space and passes view-space Z down; the fragment stage writes one `float4`: normalized view
normal in `rgb`, view-space Z in `a`.

Everything downstream lives in view space, the natural frame for screen-space marching. Normals are
oriented relative to the camera, and Z is a linear distance consumers can compare and reconstruct
positions from. The target clears to zero, so a pixel with no geometry reads `viewZ == 0`. Because the
camera looks down −Z, real surfaces store a negative Z, and consumers treat `viewZ > -1e-4` as
background.

View-Z is the half of the buffer that lets a consumer rebuild the full view-space position of any
pixel. Given a UV and its stored Z, fire a ray through the pixel in clip space, divide by `w`, and
scale to the stored depth:

```hlsl
float3 viewPosFromUv(float2 uv, float viewZ)
{
    float2 ndc = uv * 2.0 - 1.0;
    float4 r   = mul(invProjection, float4(ndc, 1.0, 1.0));
    float3 ray = r.xyz / r.w;
    return ray * (viewZ / ray.z);
}
```

That helper is copied into `gtao.slang`, `contact.slang`, and `ssgi.slang` — the shared key that turns
the thin buffer back into positions. The prepass also writes a real depth attachment (`gDepth`), so
it's depth-tested like any geometry pass.

### Why thin, and why one target

A full deferred G-buffer would store albedo, metallic-roughness, world position, and motion across
several attachments. These effects only need orientation and distance, so normal + Z in one `rgba16f`
is the whole bill. The MRT machinery in the render graph would let it grow, but there's no reason to
pay for targets nothing reads. The prepass also only runs when at least one screen-space effect is
enabled — the renderer gates it on `doScreen` (GTAO, contact, SSGI, or ReSTIR).

## In the code

| What | File | Symbols |
|---|---|---|
| Prepass shader | `gbuffer.slang` | `vertexMain`, `fragmentMain` |
| Position reconstruction | `gtao.slang`, `contact.slang`, `ssgi.slang` | `viewPosFromUv` |
| Pass declaration + gating | `renderer.cppm` | `gbuffer` pass, `doScreen`, `recordGbuffer` |
| Where it's sampled | `mesh.slang` | `aoMap`, `contactMap`, `ssgiMap` (set 4) |

> [!NOTE]
> The background test is a sign test on view-Z (`viewZ > -1e-4`), not a comparison against a far-plane
> constant. It works because the color target clears to `0` and real geometry is always at negative
> view-space Z. Change the clear value or the projection handedness and every consumer's background
> check has to change too.
