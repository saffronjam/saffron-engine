# Component registry

A component registry is a runtime table that pairs each component type with the operations
cross-cutting features perform on it: serialize, deserialize, add, remove, clone, and draw. Each
entry is a row of closures, so a feature dispatches on a component without naming its type.

Several subsystems need per-component knowledge. The serializer converts a component to and from
JSON, the editor draws, adds, and removes it, and entity cloning copies it. A registry holds that
knowledge in one place. Registering a component is a single call, and no central code changes when
a new component is added.

## The itable

`ComponentTraits` is a struct of `std::function` fields — a Go-interface vtable built by hand,
one field per operation a cross-cutting feature needs:

```cpp
struct ComponentTraits
{
    entt::id_type id = 0;   // == entt::type_hash<C>::value(); the storage() join key
    std::string name;       // stable JSON key + UI header, e.g. "Transform"
    bool removable = true;
    std::function<bool(Scene&, Entity)> has;
    std::function<void(Scene&, Entity)> addDefault;
    std::function<void(Scene&, Entity)> remove;
    std::function<void(Scene&, Entity, Scene&, Entity)> copyTo;        // clone src -> dst
    std::function<nlohmann::json(Scene&, Entity)> serialize;
    std::function<Result<void>(Scene&, Entity, const nlohmann::json&)> deserialize;
    std::function<void(Scene&, Entity)> drawInspector;  // opaque hook; the engine renders no UI
};
```

The `ComponentRegistry` is a vector of these rows plus two indexes: `byId` (keyed by the entt
type hash, the same id entt's `storage()` iteration yields) and `byName` (keyed by the stable
JSON string). Both map to the same row.

## Registering is one call

`registerComponent<C>` takes the type, a name, and three closures: a draw function, a to-JSON, and
a from-JSON. It synthesizes everything else from the generic component functions. `has`,
`addDefault`, `remove`, `copyTo`, and the `Scene/Entity` adapters around `serialize`/`deserialize`
are all generated.

```cpp
template <typename C>
void registerComponent(ComponentRegistry& reg, std::string name,
                       std::function<void(Scene&, Entity)> drawFn,
                       std::function<nlohmann::json(const C&)> toJson,
                       std::function<Result<void>(C&, const nlohmann::json&)> fromJson,
                       bool removable = true);
```

The caller writes only the genuinely per-component part: how its fields map to JSON. The draw
closure is an empty stub since the engine renders no UI. The `deserialize` closure adds the
component with defaults before calling `fromJson`, so a load never assumes the component already
exists. Every built-in component is registered this way in `scene_edit_components.cpp`, one call
each.

## Lookup feeds both directions

```cpp
auto findById(const ComponentRegistry&, entt::id_type) -> const ComponentTraits*;
auto findByName(const ComponentRegistry&, const std::string&) -> const ComponentTraits*;
```

Serialization walks `scene.registry.storage()`, takes each storage's id, and calls `findById` to
discover what to write. Loading reads JSON keys and calls `findByName`. The two indexes let one
table drive both the type-keyed and string-keyed paths.

## Why closures, not entt::meta

entt ships a reflection system, `entt::meta`, that could carry this data. The engine uses a
hand-built struct-of-closures for the reason the rest of the codebase avoids heavy machinery. A
`std::function` table is plain, debuggable data read top to bottom, and it keeps the per-component
JSON code next to the registration call rather than scattered across reflection attributes.
The `drawInspector` field stays opaque at the scene layer, but the engine renders no UI, so its
closure is an empty stub and the real inspector is the React frontend, which builds each field from
the DTO catalog over the control plane.

> [!TIP]
> The `name` string is a stable contract, not a display nicety. It is the JSON key on disk and
> the editor's component header. Renaming it silently breaks every saved scene that used the old
> name (the loader logs `unknown component '<old>', skipping`). Treat it like a serialization
> version.
