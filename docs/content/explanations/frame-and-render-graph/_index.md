# Frame & render graph

A render graph describes one frame of rendering as a set of passes and the resources they read and
write. Each pass declares its usage of a resource; the graph derives the barriers and layout
transitions and records the pass body. No pass writes a pipeline barrier by hand. Application
layers add their own passes to the cull → scene → UI frame.
