# Tooling & control

The control plane is a JSON-over-unix-socket protocol that drives a running editor from outside the process. The socket is non-blocking and drained once per frame on the main thread, so commands apply between frames without stalling the render loop. Through it the `se` CLI creates entities, sets components, imports assets, toggles render features, and grabs screenshots. Each engine feature ships a matching command, which keeps the editor scriptable and visually debuggable from a shell.
