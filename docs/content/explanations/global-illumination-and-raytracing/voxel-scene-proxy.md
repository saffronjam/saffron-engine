# Voxel proxy

DDGI rays don't trace real triangles. They march through a coarse voxel copy of the scene that's
rebuilt every frame: a 32³ 3D image where each occupied voxel stores the albedo of whatever fills
it. Because it's a software grid, the whole DDGI trace runs on any GPU with no ray-tracing
hardware.

## The 3D image

The proxy is an `Image3D` — a VMA-allocated 3D image, kept separate from the 2D `Image` type. It
is created once at `DdgiVoxelRes`³ (32³) in `rgba16f`, with storage *and* sampled usage so the
same image can be written by the voxelize pass and read by the trace (`newImage3D`, type `e3D`,
usage `Storage | Sampled`).

## Rasterizing AABBs, not triangles

`ddgi_voxelize.slang` runs one thread per voxel (a 4×4×4 thread group over the 32³ grid). Each
thread computes its voxel's world-space center and tests it against a small SSBO of per-draw world
AABBs. Inside any box, the voxel stores that box's albedo with occupancy `a = 1`; otherwise it
clears to `a = 0`.

The trade is exactness for cost. A box voxelizes perfectly; an arbitrary mesh gets a coarse AABB
fill that's too solid (a sphere becomes a cube). For a *global* diffuse GI proxy that's fine — the
indirect bounce is low-frequency and the surface itself is shaded with real geometry. Conservative
triangle rasterization into the grid would cost far more for a term that's blurred across probes
anyway.

## Where the boxes come from

`renderScene` walks the scene's `TransformComponent` + `MeshComponent` entities and, for each,
transforms the mesh's local AABB corners into world space to get a world AABB plus the material
base color. Those go into three parallel arrays handed to `setDdgiScene`, which interleaves them
`[min, max, albedo]` into the mapped box SSBO and flushes it.

## Fitting the volume

`setDdgiScene` also receives a volume placement, computed in `renderScene` from the scene's
overall world AABB padded by one unit:

```cpp
const glm::vec3 volMin = sceneMin - glm::vec3{ 1.0f };
const glm::vec3 volExt = (sceneMax + glm::vec3{ 1.0f }) - volMin;
```

The 32³ voxels and the 8×4×8 probes both span this volume, so a voxel's world size is
`volumeExtent / 32` and probe spacing is `volumeExtent / probeCount`. Move the scene and the
volume re-fits next frame — the proxy is never stale because it's never cached.

## Layout in the graph

The voxelize pass declares the 3D image as `StorageImageRWCompute` (written in `GENERAL`). The
trace pass reads it through the *same* RW-storage usage rather than a sampled read, deliberately:
the graph's `StorageReadCompute` usage is modeled for buffers (layout `Undefined`) and would
mis-transition a 3D image, so the voxels stay in `GENERAL` across both passes and the
[render graph](../../frame-and-render-graph/render-graph-overview/) inserts a plain write→read
memory barrier.

## In the code

| What | File | Symbols |
|---|---|---|
| Voxelize shader | `ddgi_voxelize.slang` | `computeMain`, `Box`, the AABB test |
| 3D image type | `renderer_types.cppm` | `Image3D` |
| 3D image allocation | `renderer_detail.cppm` | `newImage3D` |
| Box upload + volume fit | `renderer.cppm` | `setDdgiScene` |
| World AABBs from the scene | `assets.cppm` | `renderScene` (corner-transform loop) |
| Voxelize graph pass | `renderer.cppm` | `ddgi-voxelize` pass (the `doDdgi` block) |

> [!WARNING]
> The voxelize loop is `O(voxels × boxes)` — every voxel tests every box linearly, with no spatial
> acceleration. At 32³ voxels that's fine for a few dozen draws. The box SSBO is capped at
> `boxCapacity`; extra draws past the cap are dropped from the proxy (they still shade normally,
> they just don't contribute indirect bounce).
