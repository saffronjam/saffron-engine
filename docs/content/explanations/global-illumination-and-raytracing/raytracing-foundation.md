# Acceleration structures

The hardware ray-tracing path traces real triangles, not the voxel proxy. It needs two
acceleration structures: a per-mesh **BLAS** (bottom-level, the triangles) built once on upload,
and a per-frame **TLAS** (top-level, the scene's instances) rebuilt every frame. The TLAS lets a
ray query the whole scene by walking instances down into their meshes' triangles. Both are owned as
RAII meta-layer resources and fed buffer device addresses.

> [!NOTE]
> The RT path is feature-gated (see [device gating](../raytracing-device-gating/)). On the
> software dev GPU it runs at roughly 1 FPS, so it's correctness-validated and waits on real
> ray-tracing hardware.

## The acceleration-structure resource

A BLAS and a TLAS are the same `AccelerationStructure` type: a move-only wrapper owning the
`vk::AccelerationStructureKHR` handle, its backing device buffer, and its device address. Like
every [meta-layer resource](../../vulkan-foundation/) it frees itself in order (handle, then
buffer) before the allocator. It destroys through a resolved function pointer because the destroy
entry point isn't statically exported.

`createAccelStructure` is the shared constructor: it allocates the storage buffer (with
`ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_STORAGE` + `SHADER_DEVICE_ADDRESS` usage), calls
`vkCreateAccelerationStructureKHR`, then fetches the AS device address. The caller records the
build separately.

## One BLAS per mesh, built on upload

`buildBlas` builds a bottom-level AS over a `GpuMesh`'s whole vertex/index buffer as a single
triangles geometry. The vertex and index data are passed by *device address* — which is why those
buffers, and BDA on the allocator, are enabled when RT is supported.

The build queries its sizes (`getBuildSizes`), allocates the AS plus a scratch buffer, and records
the build on a one-off command buffer with a `waitIdle` — the same synchronous shape as mesh
upload, since it happens once at load. It uses `PREFER_FAST_TRACE` and no compaction (correctness
first for v1). The result is stored as `GpuMesh::blas`, a `Ref` that's null when RT is unsupported.

## One TLAS per frame, over the instances

The TLAS references the BLASes by their device address, one `VkAccelerationStructureInstanceKHR`
per drawn mesh instance. `renderScene` hands the frame's model matrices and meshes to `setRtScene`,
and a graph compute pass calls `buildTlas`, which packs the instances and records the build into
the frame's command buffer:

```cpp
VkAccelerationStructureInstanceKHR inst{};
// VkTransformMatrixKHR is row-major 3x4; glm is column-major — transpose into rows.
for (u32 r = 0; r < 3; r++) for (u32 c = 0; c < 4; c++)
    inst.transform.matrix[r][c] = m[c][r];
inst.mask = 0xFF;
inst.accelerationStructureReference = meshes[i]->blas->address;
```

The instance buffer is host-visible, ping-ponged per in-flight frame, and grown to the next power
of two when the instance count outgrows it. The TLAS and its scratch are (re)created only when
capacity changes; otherwise the same TLAS is rebuilt in place. After the build, `recordTlasBuild`
writes the new TLAS into the frame's descriptor set (set 6) and emits the AS-build→fragment-shader
barrier itself.

## The empty-TLAS seed

The mesh fragment statically references the TLAS in set 6 regardless of the runtime flag, so the
descriptor must always point at a valid AS. `seedEmptyTlas` builds a zero-instance TLAS at init and
writes it into every frame's set. The first real per-frame build overwrites a slot on demand; until
then, ray queries against the empty TLAS simply miss.

## In the code

| What | File | Symbols |
|---|---|---|
| The AS resource | `renderer_types.cppm` | `AccelerationStructure`, `Rt` |
| Create / size / address | `renderer_detail.cppm` | `createAccelStructure`, `makeRtBuffer`, `bufferDeviceAddress` |
| Per-mesh BLAS | `renderer_detail.cppm` | `buildBlas` |
| Per-frame TLAS | `renderer_detail.cppm` | `recordTlasBuild`, `ensureTlasCapacity`, `seedEmptyTlas` |
| Frame instance capture + build | `renderer.cppm` | `setRtScene`, `buildTlas`; `assets.cppm` · `renderScene` |
| TLAS-build graph pass | `renderer.cppm` | `tlas-build` pass |

> [!WARNING]
> `VkTransformMatrixKHR` is a row-major 3×4; GLM is column-major. `buildTlas` transposes each model
> matrix into rows when packing instances — skip that and instances render at the wrong transform
> (or mirrored). The BLAS build is also a synchronous `waitIdle` per mesh, fine for load-time upload
> but a stall if ever called per frame.
