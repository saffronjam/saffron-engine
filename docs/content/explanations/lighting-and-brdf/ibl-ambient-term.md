# IBL ambient term

The ambient term is the indirect light a surface receives: everything bounced off the
environment — the sky, nearby surfaces — rather than arriving straight from a source. Direct
lights account only for the latter, so a surface lit by direct lights alone is black wherever no
light points at it.

The fragment shader adds the ambient term on top of the direct sum. It computes that term one of
two ways: as image-based lighting through the split-sum approximation, or, when IBL is off, as a
flat scalar fill.

## Two ambient paths

The shader branches on `globals.counts.z`, the IBL-enabled flag. When IBL is ready it evaluates
the split-sum; otherwise it falls back to a constant:

```hlsl
if (globals.counts.z != 0)
    ambient = /* split-sum IBL */;
else
    ambient = albedo * (1.0 - metallic) * globals.directionAmbient.w;  // flat fallback
```

The fallback is the [directional light's](../directional-light/) `ambient` scalar
(`directionAmbient.w`) times the diffuse albedo — a constant fill so unlit surfaces are not pure
black. It carries no directionality and no specular.

## Split-sum IBL

The IBL term splits the ambient into diffuse and specular halves, each precomputed into a cubemap
or LUT so the fragment does only a few texture fetches. The diffuse half samples a convolved
irradiance cube $E(n)$ in the normal direction:

$$
\text{diffuse}_\text{IBL} = k_d \cdot \text{albedo} \cdot E(n)
$$

with $k_d = (1 - F)(1 - \text{metallic})$, the same energy-conservation factor the direct BRDF
uses, here with a roughness-aware Fresnel. The specular half is the split-sum approximation: a
prefiltered environment cube sampled in the reflection direction at a mip chosen by roughness,
scaled by a two-term BRDF integration LUT:

$$
\text{specular}_\text{IBL} = \text{prefiltered}(R,\ \text{roughness}) \cdot (F_0 \cdot \text{LUT}.x + \text{LUT}.y)
$$

```hlsl
float3 F          = fresnelSchlickRoughness(ndotv, F0, roughness);
float3 kd         = (1.0 - F) * (1.0 - metallic);
float3 diffuseIBL = kd * irradianceMap.SampleLevel(n, 0.0).rgb * albedo;
float3 R          = reflect(-v, n);
float3 prefiltered = prefilteredMap.SampleLevel(R, roughness * IblPrefilterMaxMip).rgb;
float2 ab          = brdfLut.SampleLevel(float2(ndotv, roughness), 0.0).rg;
ambient = diffuseIBL + prefiltered * (F0 * ab.x + ab.y);
```

Roughness selects the prefilter mip: a mirror reads the sharp top mip, a rough surface reads a
blurred low one. The maps themselves — irradiance cube, prefiltered cube, BRDF LUT — are bound on
set 3; how they are convolved is the [image-based lighting](../../image-based-lighting/) topic.

## Modulation: AO, SSGI, DDGI

Several screen- and world-space effects refine the ambient term after either path produces it.
Each is gated by its own flag and touches only the indirect term, never the direct lights:

- **AO** (`counts.w`) multiplies the ambient by a screen-space occlusion factor, darkening
  creases the IBL cube cannot see.
- **SSGI** (`screenFlags.y`) adds one-bounce screen-space indirect onto the diffuse albedo.
- **DDGI** (`screenFlags.z`) adds world-space multi-bounce irradiance from a probe cage.

The final color is `lo + ambient + emissive`: direct plus indirect plus the surface's own
emission, all in linear HDR.

## In the code

| What | File | Symbols |
|---|---|---|
| Ambient branch | `mesh.slang` | `fragmentMain` — `globals.counts.z` |
| Split-sum specular | `mesh.slang` | `prefilteredMap`, `brdfLut`, `IblPrefilterMaxMip` |
| Roughness Fresnel | `mesh.slang` | `fresnelSchlickRoughness` |
| Flat fallback | `mesh.slang` | `directionAmbient.w` |
| Indirect modulation | `mesh.slang` | `aoMap`, `ssgiMap`, `ddgiSampleIrradiance` |

> [!TIP]
> AO, SSGI, and DDGI modulate only the ambient term; they never touch the direct lights.
> Darkening direct lighting with AO double-counts shadowing the direct shadow maps already
> handle.
