# Brute-force fallback

The fragment shader can loop every light instead of just its froxel's. That brute-force path
is the reference: simpler, slower, and the ground truth the [clustered](../clustered-forward/)
path is validated against. `se set-clustered 0` flips to it at runtime.

## One flag, two loops

The flag rides in the cluster params (`screenSize.z`), set from `useClustered` in
`setClusterCamera`. When it is zero there is no cluster lookup at all, and the loop runs over
the full light count from the lighting UBO:

```hlsl
else
{
    for (uint i = 0; i < globals.counts.x; i = i + 1)
    {
        lo += punctual(lights[i], i, input.worldPos, n, v, albedo, metallic, roughness);
    }
}
```

The body is the same `punctual(...)` call the clustered loop makes; only the iteration set
differs. When the flag is off, `clusterDispatchPending` is never set, so the
[cull pass](../clustered-forward/) is not even added to the render graph that frame.

## Why the two paths match

The clustered and brute-force paths produce pixel-identical images, by construction. Both
call the same `punctual` → `brdf` functions, so a given light shades a fragment the same way
either way. And a light is added to a froxel only when its `range` sphere overlaps, while
punctual [attenuation](../punctual-lights-and-attenuation/) is windowed to reach exactly zero
at `range`. So any light the clustered loop skips would have contributed exactly zero anyway.

Summing a set of lights where the omitted ones are all zero gives the same result as summing
all of them. Float summation order can differ, but every dropped term is a hard zero, so
there is nothing to perturb the result. Toggling `se set-clustered` between 1 and 0
reproduces the same frame.

## What it is for

Cluster culling has several places to get a sign or a slice boundary wrong: the exponential Z
mapping, the AABB construction, the flat index encoding. Diffing a clustered frame against the
brute-force frame is the cheapest way to catch those. It is also the safe default when the
light count is small enough that culling is not worth the compute dispatch.

## In the code

| What | File | Symbols |
|---|---|---|
| The two loops | `mesh.slang` | `fragmentMain` — `clusterParams.screenSize.z` branch |
| Shared per-light body | `mesh.slang` | `punctual`, `brdf` |
| The flag | `renderer_lighting.cpp` | `setClustered`, `clusteredEnabled` |
| Skipping the cull pass | `renderer_lighting.cpp` | `clusterDispatchPending` |

> [!TIP]
> The brute-force loop reads `globals.counts.x` (the full count); the clustered loop reads a
> per-froxel `count` bounded by [the 64-light cap](../per-cluster-cap/). With more than 64
> lights overlapping a froxel the two paths can diverge — the brute-force loop sees every
> light, the clustered one drops the overflow. Pixel-identity holds below the cap.
