# Assets panel & thumbnails

The Assets panel is a tile grid over the project's [asset catalog](../../scene-and-ecs/asset-catalog-in-scene/). Each tile shows a thumbnail and an editable name, and acts as a drag source for the inspector's [pickers](../asset-pickers-and-drag-drop/).

Thumbnails are PNGs fetched over the control socket and cached as blob URLs, because the engine and the webview share no GPU context. The panel itself is a React component reading `store.assets`.

## The tile grid

`AssetsPanel` lays the catalog out with a CSS grid (`repeat(auto-fill, minmax(72px, 1fr))`), so tiles reflow to the panel width. Each `AssetTile` is a 72px tile: a square thumbnail on top, an in-place name button beneath. An empty catalog shows an import and drag-and-drop prompt instead. The list comes from the reconcile poll's `list-assets` refresh, re-fetched eagerly after an import or rename.

## Thumbnails over the socket

A thumbnail travels as data rather than a registered descriptor, since no GPU context is shared. `get-thumbnail` renders the asset to a small offscreen and reads it back as a **base64 PNG** in the JSON result; the client decodes it to a `Blob` and an object URL:

- a **texture** asset renders its own decoded image;
- a **mesh** asset renders a [3D preview](../mesh-thumbnails/);
- anything else, or a failed render, falls back to a Lucide type icon in the webview.

Each `get-thumbnail` call is a GPU→CPU readback plus a PNG encode, so it must not run per frame or per tile. A module-scope cache keyed by asset id holds `{ blob URL, the px size it was fetched at }`, and concurrent requests for the same asset share one in-flight promise. A cached URL is reused whenever it is at least as large as the requested size, so a 128px grid tile and a 16px combo swatch share one fetch:

```ts
export async function getThumbnailUrl(assetId: string, size: number): Promise<string> {
  const cached = thumbnailCache.get(assetId);
  if (cached && cached.size >= size) return cached.url;     // hit
  const inflight = thumbnailInflight.get(assetId);
  if (inflight) return inflight;                            // dedupe
  // miss → get-thumbnail, decode base64 PNG, store the object URL
}
```

When the catalog changes, on a project or scene load, every cached blob URL is stale. `invalidateThumbnails` revokes them all, and the lazy cache re-fetches on demand.

## Rename in place

Double-clicking a tile's name turns it into an input bound to a draft string. Enter or blur commits with `rename-asset`; Escape cancels. The engine returns the new `{id, name}`, and the catalog refresh reflects it. Names are UTF-8, so non-Latin names round-trip through the project file; rendering them needs a broader font, a known follow-up.

```ts
void client.renameAsset(entry.id, next).then(() => refreshAssets());
```

## Import and drag-drop

The **Import** button opens the Tauri file dialog (`tauri-plugin-dialog`); the panel is also an **OS file-drop** target via the webview drag-drop event. Both route by extension: images go to `import-texture` (catalog-only, no spawn), everything else to `import-model`, matching the engine's `importToCatalog`. The OS file-drop is hit-tested against the panel's rect, scaled by `devicePixelRatio` because the drop position is in physical pixels. Dropping a model on the *viewport* therefore does not trigger a catalog import here.

Each tile is also an HTML5 drag *source* on a distinct channel, `application/x-se-asset`, separate from the OS file drop. It carries `{id, type}` so an inspector [picker](../asset-pickers-and-drag-drop/) can type-gate the drop.

## The View modal

Double-clicking a tile opens a 512px preview in a shadcn `Dialog` (`view-asset`, the same readback path as `get-thumbnail`). The [viewport](../viewport-panel/) is a `<canvas>` the webview paints, so the dialog stacks over it by `z-index` like any other modal — there is no foreign window to occlude it and nothing to park.
