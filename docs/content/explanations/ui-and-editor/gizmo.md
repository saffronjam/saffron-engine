# Transform gizmo

A transform gizmo is an on-screen widget that edits a selected entity's translation, rotation, or scale by dragging handles drawn over it in the viewport. It is the direct-manipulation alternative to typing transform values into a panel.

The gizmo is rendered by the engine, not the UI. Under [present-only mode](../tauri-editor-and-viewport-transport/) ImGui is skipped, so there is no ImGuizmo path; the engine draws the handles itself and the webview forwards pointer intent and the chosen mode over the control socket.

## Engine-rendered overlay

The gizmo is part of the scene the engine presents. An overlay pipeline runs at the offscreen's native (1x) resolution *after* the tonemap pass, so the handles stay crisp and unaffected by exposure, MSAA resolve, or post-process. Because it is engine-side, the gizmo lines up exactly with the meshes it manipulates: it projects through the same [editor camera](../editor-camera/) the scene draws with, so there is no second projection to keep in sync.

The light and camera billboards are drawn the same way. The engine projects each non-mesh entity to screen space and draws an icon, so a light or camera is selectable in the viewport even though it has no geometry.

## The gizmo-pointer command

The handles are drawn into the frame stream the webview paints, so the engine receives no raw mouse from the canvas. The [viewport panel](../viewport-panel/) therefore translates each pointer phase into NDC and forwards it with the `gizmo-pointer` command:

```ts
gizmoPointer(phase: GizmoPointerPhase, x: number, y: number): Promise<unknown> {
  return callRaw("gizmo-pointer", { phase, x, y });
}
```

`phase` is one of `hover | begin | drag | end`, and `x`/`y` are NDC in `[-1, 1]` (the same `u*2-1` mapping `pick` uses). The phases map to a gesture:

- A bare move streams `hover`, so the engine highlights the handle under the cursor.
- A press sends `begin`.
- Travel past a few pixels turns the gesture into a `drag`, streamed and throttled; it sets `store.dragActive` so the reconcile poll will not clobber the in-progress transform.
- The release always sends `end`, where the engine commits the authoritative transform.

A press that does not move is a click, and [ray-picks](../selection/) instead of dragging.

## Mode and space

The operation (T/R/S) and the world/local space are **one** shared gizmo state on the engine, read and written through `get-gizmo`/`set-gizmo`. A single source of truth keeps the Topbar buttons, the keyboard shortcuts, and an external `se set-gizmo` in agreement.

- The **Topbar** has a T/R/S button group and a World/Local toggle. A click updates `store.gizmo` optimistically and fires `set-gizmo`.
- **W/E/R** map to translate/rotate/scale, bound on the webview (gated off while a text field is focused so typing a value never retargets the gizmo).
- The reconcile poll's `get-gizmo` read folds any external change back into `store.gizmo`, so the Topbar stays correct no matter who set the mode.
