# Tauri editor and the X11 viewport bridge

The editor is a Tauri desktop application: a React/TypeScript front-end in a webview, a thin Rust backend, and the engine running as a separate process. The webview never renders the 3D scene. The engine's own SDL/Vulkan window is reparented as a native child over a placeholder div, so the viewport shows the engine presenting directly to its swapchain while the webview owns the surrounding chrome.

Every editor operation that touches the scene rides the same JSON-over-unix-socket [control protocol](../../tooling-and-control/control-plane-architecture/) the `se` CLI speaks. The engine project builds the `SaffronEngine` host executable — a present-only viewport host that boots the engine, opens its window, and drains the control socket, with no panels of its own.

## Two processes, one socket

The Rust backend spawns `SaffronEngine` with `SAFFRON_EDITOR_NATIVE_VIEWPORT=1`, a per-instance `SAFFRON_CONTROL_SOCK` (pid-scoped, so two editor windows do not collide), and `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=x11`. The engine is then the renderer and the webview is the UI, talking only over that socket.

The TypeScript side is a typed client over one generic Rust passthrough. Every scene, asset, and render command is `invoke('control', { cmd, params })`; the Rust layer forwards it verbatim, turns an engine `ok:false` into a rejected promise, and otherwise resolves the result JSON. Adding a new `se` command needs no Rust change — the typed wrapper in `client.ts` and a schema entry are all that move.

```ts
async function call<C extends keyof CommandResultMap>(
  cmd: C,
  params?: object,
): Promise<CommandResultMap[C]> {
  return invoke<CommandResultMap[C]>("control", { cmd, params: params ?? {} });
}
```

Rust handles only the window-handle lifecycle commands directly — `start_engine`, `attach_native_viewport`, `resize_native_viewport`, `quit_engine`, `engine_alive` — because those manipulate the native X11 window rather than the scene.

## The present-only bridge

With `SAFFRON_EDITOR_NATIVE_VIEWPORT` set, the engine runs in present-only mode: it renders the scene and the editor overlays — the [gizmo](../gizmo/) and the light and camera billboards — into its offscreen target and blits that straight to the swapchain. The engine has no UI toolkit and no engine-side panels. `presentViewportToSwapchain` performs the offscreen-to-swapchain blit (`transferSrc` to `transferDst`, then `PresentSrcKHR`).

Attaching is a reparent, not a copy. `attach-native-viewport` reads the Tauri window's X11 display and window number, then `XReparentWindow`s the engine's SDL window under it, `XMoveResizeWindow`s it to the viewport rect, and `XMapRaised`s it. There is no per-frame transfer — the engine owns its surface and the compositor stacks it over the webview. Because an X11 child holds no keyboard focus, the engine receives mouse events (delivered by cursor position) but not keystrokes; the [editor camera](../editor-camera/) grabs the keyboard only while the right mouse button is held, so WASD reaches the engine during a fly without stealing focus from the webview otherwise.

> [!NOTE]
> The reparented child requires Xlib, so the editor is X11/XWayland only. Native Wayland cannot reparent a foreign window, and is a non-goal.

## Auto-start, auto-attach, loading overlay

On boot the Rust `.setup()` hook spawns the engine, then polls `viewport-native-info` with a child-liveness-aware bounded retry that distinguishes "socket not bound yet" from "process crashed". React drives an `engineStatus.phase` state machine — `idle → starting → attaching → ready` — and the [Viewport panel](../viewport-panel/) waits for a non-zero rect before sending the first `attach-native-viewport`. A `<LoadingOverlay/>` covers the viewport region until `phase === 'ready'`.

The overlay must be a plain absolutely-positioned sibling inside the viewport panel, never a Radix portal. The engine only `XMapRaised`s the native window on a successful attach, so before that the webview can still paint over the unmapped rect.

## Crash recovery

The reconcile poll doubles as a liveness watchdog: each tick it calls `engineAlive()`, which uses `child.try_wait()` rather than a stale handle, so a dead engine reads as dead. If the child has exited, the store flips `phase` back to `error`, the overlay reappears, and it offers **Retry** (re-attach) and **Restart** (quit, re-spawn, re-attach).
