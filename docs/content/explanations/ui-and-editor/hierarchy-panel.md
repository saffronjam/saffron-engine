# Hierarchy panel

The Hierarchy panel is the editor view that lists every entity in the scene and provides create, copy, delete, and select operations on them. The list is flat, since the scene has no parenting.

The panel renders directly from the store's `entities` slice and never fetches on its own. The [reconcile poll](../selection/) keeps that slice current, and the panel re-renders whenever it changes.

## A render of the store

The list comes from `store.entities`, which the reconcile poll refreshes only when `sceneVersion` changes. Each entity is a row: a left-click selects it, a right-click opens a Radix context menu with Copy and Delete. The header carries a Create dropdown, [the same preset list](#creating-entities) the menu bar uses.

The context menu and Create dropdown are Radix portals to the document root. The [viewport](../viewport-panel/) is a `<canvas>` the webview paints, so these menus stack over it by `z-index` like any other DOM overlay.

## Selection is optimistic

Clicking a row sets the selection locally and tells the engine in the same step, so the row highlights without waiting a poll interval:

```ts
const onSelect = (entity: EntityRef): void => {
  selectEntity(entity.id);            // optimistic local highlight
  void client.selectEntity(entity.id).catch(() => {});
};
```

The poll confirms via `selectionVersion`; the engine is authoritative if a newer version arrives. See [Selection](../selection/) for the round-trip.

## Creating entities

The Create dropdown maps menu labels to `add-entity` presets — Empty, Cube, Point/Spot/Directional Light, Camera. The engine spawns the entity, adds the right component, and auto-selects it. On success the panel mirrors that selection locally, and the `sceneVersion` bump refreshes the list. The engine resolves and uploads the cube mesh itself behind `add-entity cube`.

## Copy and delete

Copy and delete go through the engine, so the commands are safe to call directly from a menu handler:

```ts
const onCopy = (id) =>
  void client.copyEntity(id).then((ref) => selectEntity(ref.id)).catch(() => {});

const onDelete = (id) => {
  if (store.selectedId === id) setSelectedId(null);  // clear if it was selected
  void client.destroyEntity(id).catch(() => {});
};
```

`copy-entity` is a deep duplicate on the engine side — every component, a fresh UUID — and selects the copy; the panel mirrors that selection and lets the `sceneVersion` bump refresh the list. `destroy-entity` clears the selection locally first when the deleted entity was selected, matching the engine's own clear-on-destroy.

Rename is not inline here; it lives in the Inspector's `Name` field.

## In the code

| What | File | Symbols |

| The panel | `editor/src/panels/HierarchyPanel.tsx` | `HierarchyPanel`, `onSelect`, `onCopy`, `onDelete` |
| Create presets | `editor/src/app/CreateMenu.tsx` | `CREATE_PRESETS`, `CreateMenu` |
| The entity list slice | `editor/src/state/store.ts` | `entities`, `sceneVersion`, `setEntities` |
| Commands (engine) | `control_commands_scene.cpp` | `list-entities`, `add-entity`, `copy-entity`, `destroy-entity`, `select` |
