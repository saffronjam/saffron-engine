# Type aliases

`Saffron.Core` sits at the bottom of the module DAG, and most of what it exports is small:
fixed-width number aliases and a couple of value types every other module reaches for. The
point is that the names are short and spelled the same everywhere.

## Number aliases

The integer and float types get short, Go-like names so a field declaration reads the same
width as the type it holds:

```cpp
using u8  = std::uint8_t;
using u32 = std::uint32_t;
using u64 = std::uint64_t;
using f32 = float;
using f64 = double;
// … i8…i64, u16 …
```

These are used in preference to `int`, `unsigned`, `float`, and `size_t` throughout the
codebase. A vertex count is a `u32`, a hash or identity is a `u64`, a shader push constant
is an `f32`. The width is part of the name, so a struct laid out for the GPU shows its byte
layout at a glance.

## TimeSpan

A duration is a `TimeSpan`, a one-field struct holding seconds, with a free function to
read it in other units. This is the [Go-flavored](../go-flavored-design/) shape in
miniature: plain data, and a free function that transforms it rather than a method buried
on the type. The frame delta passed to a layer's `onUpdate` is a `TimeSpan`.

```cpp
struct TimeSpan
{
    f32 seconds = 0.0f;
};

constexpr auto toMilliseconds(TimeSpan span) -> f32 { return span.seconds * 1000.0f; }
```

## Uuid and newUuid

`Uuid` is a stable 64-bit identity. It exists because entt's own `entt::entity` values are
not stable across runs — they get reused as entities are created and destroyed — so
anything serialized and reloaded carries a `Uuid` instead.

```cpp
auto newUuid() -> Uuid
{
    static std::mt19937_64 engine{ std::random_device{}() };
    static std::uniform_int_distribution<u64> distribution{ 1, std::numeric_limits<u64>::max() };
    return Uuid{ distribution(engine) };
}
```

`newUuid` draws from a static Mersenne Twister seeded once from `random_device`. The
distribution starts at 1, so a fresh `Uuid` is never zero — zero reads as "unset", which
is the default member initializer. Catalog assets and saved-scene entities are keyed by
`Uuid`, which is how a reloaded `project.json` reconnects a `MeshComponent` to the right
mesh.

## In the code

| What | File | Symbols |
|---|---|---|
| Width aliases | `core.cppm` | `u8`…`u64`, `i8`…`i64`, `f32`, `f64` |
| Duration | `core.cppm` | `TimeSpan`, `toMilliseconds` |
| Stable identity | `core.cppm` | `Uuid`, `newUuid` |
| Engine name/version | `core.cppm` | `EngineName`, `EngineVersion` |

> [!NOTE]
> A default-constructed `Uuid` has `value == 0`, and `newUuid` never returns zero. Treat
> zero as the unset sentinel — don't compare a fresh `Uuid` against `Uuid{}` expecting a
> match.
