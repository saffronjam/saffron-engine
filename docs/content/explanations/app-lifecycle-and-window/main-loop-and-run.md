# Main loop

The main loop is the single function that owns a program's window, renderer, and UI, and runs
one fixed sequence of work every frame until the window closes. In Saffron that function is
`se::run`. A client supplies an `AppConfig` and calls `run`; `run` drives everything and calls
back into the client's layers at fixed points.

The shape is a config and a call, not a base class. There is no application to subclass and no
virtual `update` to override; the loop calls back through the layers the client attached.

```cpp
struct AppConfig
{
    WindowConfig window;
    std::function<void(App&)> onCreate;  // runs once, after window + renderer + ui exist
    std::function<void(App&)> onExit;    // runs during teardown
};

auto run(AppConfig config) -> int;       // returns a process exit code
```

## Startup

`run` builds the three subsystems in order and checks each with the
[error-handling](../../core-and-conventions/error-handling/) pattern: `newWindow`, then
`newRenderer`, then `newUi`. If one fails, `run` tears down whatever already exists and
returns 1.

`onCreate` runs next. That is where the client attaches its layers and wires window signals.
Every layer's `onAttach` fires after that, and `onClose` is subscribed right after window
creation so closing the window flips `app.running` to false.

## One iteration

The loop body is the contract every feature plugs into, and its order is fixed. Input comes
first, then logic, then the GPU frame. Inside the frame the UI is recorded before the graph is
built, so ImGui's draw data is ready when the frame executes.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    P[pollEvents] --> U[for each layer: onUpdate dt]
    U --> M{minimized or beginFrame fails?}
    M -- yes --> P
    M -- no --> R[for each layer: onRender — submit GPU work]
    R --> UI[uiBeginFrame → onUi → uiEndFrame → uiRecordDrawData]
    UI --> BG[beginFrameGraph — engine adds cull + scene passes]
    BG --> OG[for each layer: onRenderGraph — app adds passes]
    OG --> EF[endFrame — derive barriers, execute graph, present]
    EF --> P
```

`beginFrame` returns false when the swapchain cannot be acquired, during a resize or a
minimized window, and the loop skips rendering that iteration rather than erroring. `delta` is
a wall-clock `TimeSpan` from `steady_clock`, passed to every `onUpdate`.

The two render seams are deliberately different. `onRender` is the immediate
[submit seam](../the-submit-and-rendergraph-seams/): it records commands into the current
frame. `onRenderGraph` hands the layer the live frame graph so it can *add passes*, which is
how an app-authored post-process step slots in between the scene and the present. The engine's
cull and scene passes are already in the graph by the time layers see it.

## Shutdown order

When the loop ends, `run` calls `waitGpuIdle` **before** anything is torn down. This is the
resource-lifetime contract. `onDetach` and `onExit` are where the client drops its resource
`Ref`s, and those resources must not be freed while a command buffer still references them.
Idling the GPU first guarantees nothing in flight outlives the allocator; the reverse order
frees a buffer the GPU is still reading.

```cpp
waitGpuIdle(app.renderer);          // finish all in-flight GPU work first
for (Layer& layer : app.layers) if (layer.onDetach) layer.onDetach();
if (config.onExit) config.onExit(app);
// optional SAFFRON_CAPTURE dump here
destroyUi(...); destroyRenderer(...); destroyWindow(...);
```

## Headless runs

Two environment variables make `run` scriptable for verification. `SAFFRON_EXIT_AFTER_FRAMES=N`
counts frames and exits cleanly after `N`, parsed strictly so a malformed value logs and is
ignored. `SAFFRON_CAPTURE=path` dumps the offscreen viewport image to a file after the loop.
See [headless runs and capture](../headless-and-capture/).
