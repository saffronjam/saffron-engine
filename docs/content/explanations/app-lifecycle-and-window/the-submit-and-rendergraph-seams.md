# Render seams

A render seam is a hook through which a layer contributes GPU work to a frame. There are two,
and they serve different intents. `onRender` records commands into a pass the engine has
already opened; `onRenderGraph` adds new passes to the frame graph between the engine's stages
and the present.

The two are not interchangeable. The dividing line is whether a layer *draws into* the world or
*inserts a stage* of its own. A mesh, debug line, or gizmo goes through `onRender`. A full-screen
effect, an extra render target, or a compute step with its own synchronization is a pass of its
own and goes through `onRenderGraph`.

## Submit seam: recording into the frame

`onRender` runs inside the frame, after `beginFrame`. From it a layer calls `submit`, which
queues a closure onto the current frame's submission list:

```cpp
void submit(Renderer& renderer, RenderFn fn)
{
    renderer.frame.sceneSubmissions.push_back(std::move(fn));
}
```

The closure takes the frame's command buffer and is replayed later, when the graph executes
the scene pass. It receives a `vk::CommandBuffer`; the seam is backend-agnostic in shape. The
layer never opens a rendering scope or manages a barrier. It records draw calls into a scope the
graph owns. `submitUi` is the same idea for an overlay pass on the swapchain; the present-only
host does not use it, since it blits the finished offscreen straight to the swapchain instead.

## Render-graph seam: adding passes

`onRenderGraph` is handed the live `RenderGraph` after the engine has already added its own
passes for the frame:

```cpp
beginFrameGraph(app.renderer);                 // engine adds cull + scene + ui passes
for (Layer& layer : app.layers)
{
    if (layer.onRenderGraph) { layer.onRenderGraph(frameGraph(app.renderer)); }
}
endFrame(app.renderer);                         // derive barriers, execute, present
```

A layer adds a pass by declaring what it reads and writes and supplying the body. The graph
derives the barriers and layout transitions from those declarations; the layer writes none. An
app-authored post-process slots in this way: it declares the offscreen as a read-modify-write
storage image, the graph inserts the layout moves around it, and it runs between the scene pass
and the present blit that reads the offscreen. The demonstrator tonemap layer is exactly this. See
[the render graph](../../frame-and-render-graph/render-graph-overview/) for how a pass is
declared and how the barriers fall out.

## In the code

| What | File | Symbols |
|---|---|---|
| The two layer hooks | `app.cppm` | `Layer::onRender`, `Layer::onRenderGraph`, `run` |
| Submit seam | `renderer.cppm` | `submit`, `submitUi`, `frame.sceneSubmissions` |
| Graph access | `renderer.cppm` | `beginFrameGraph`, `frameGraph`, `endFrame` |
| Pass declaration | `render_graph.cppm` | `RgPass`, `addPass`, `RgUsage` |

> [!TIP]
> A closure submitted from `onRender` does not run when you call `submit`. It is queued and
> replayed when the graph executes the scene pass in `endFrame`. So capture by value (or keep
> the data alive); anything you reference by pointer must still be valid at the end of the
> frame, not just at submit time.
