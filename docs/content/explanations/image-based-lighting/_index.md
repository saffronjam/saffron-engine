# Image-based lighting

Image-based lighting is the ambient, indirect term of the lighting model, where the light arriving at a surface comes from an environment image instead of a flat scalar. An environment is convolved into a diffuse irradiance cube and a roughness-prefiltered specular cube. The split-sum BRDF lookup table is baked once at startup, and the mesh shader samples all three to produce energy-conserving ambient light.
