# Explanations

How each part of the engine works and why it is built that way. Pages are grouped
into subsystems and run roughly bottom-up, so reading a section top to bottom works.

Starting cold, the shortest path through the rendering pipeline is:

1. [Error handling](core-and-conventions/error-handling/) and the Go-flavoured style
2. [Main loop](app-lifecycle-and-window/main-loop-and-run/)
3. [Render graph](frame-and-render-graph/render-graph-overview/)
4. [Cook-Torrance BRDF](lighting-and-brdf/cook-torrance-brdf/)
5. [Tonemap and exposure](screen-space-and-post/tonemap-and-exposure/)

That spans error reporting to a lit pixel on screen. Everything else fills in around
that spine.

## The subsystems

| Section | Covers |
|---|---|
| [Core & conventions](core-and-conventions/) | `Result<T>`, `Ref<T>`, signals, design philosophy |
| [App lifecycle & window](app-lifecycle-and-window/) | run loop, layers, SDL3 window and events |
| [Vulkan foundation](vulkan-foundation/) | device, VMA, sync2, dynamic rendering, RAII wrappers |
| [Frame & render graph](frame-and-render-graph/) | declared usage → automatic barriers, per-frame sync |
| [Geometry & assets](geometry-and-assets/) | mesh import, `.smesh`, GPU upload, asset catalog |
| [Scene & ECS](scene-and-ecs/) | entt, component registry, serialization, picking |
| [Materials & pipelines](materials-and-pipelines/) | übershader, PSO cache, descriptor sets, bindless |
