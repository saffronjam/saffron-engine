# Explanations

Explanations describe how each part of the engine works and why it is built that
way. Pages are grouped into subsystems and ordered bottom-up, so a section reads
top to bottom.

The shortest path through the rendering pipeline is:

1. [Error handling](core-and-conventions/error-handling/) and the Go-flavoured style
2. [Main loop](app-lifecycle-and-window/main-loop-and-run/)
3. [Render graph](frame-and-render-graph/render-graph-overview/)
4. [Cook-Torrance BRDF](lighting-and-brdf/cook-torrance-brdf/)
5. [Tonemap and exposure](screen-space-and-post/tonemap-and-exposure/)

That spans error reporting to a lit pixel on screen; the other sections fill in
around this spine.

## The subsystems
