# PBR material

Turn a plain mesh into a believable metal. You set its base color, push metallic to 1 and
roughness down, add a point light for the specular highlight to reflect, and tune the
tonemap exposure so the bright result does not clip. Every value feeds the Cook-Torrance
BRDF the engine shades with. Start from [your first scene](../your-first-scene/) or any
scene with one mesh entity.

## Set base color and metallic-roughness

A mesh's look comes from its `MaterialComponent`: a base color, an optional albedo texture,
and the PBR knobs `metallic` and `roughness`. `set-material` adds the component if missing
and merges only the fields you pass:

```sh
./cmd/se set-material Mesh --baseColor '{"x":0.95,"y":0.64,"z":0.22,"w":1}' --metallic 1 --roughness 0.25
```

That makes the cube gold: warm base color, fully metallic, fairly smooth. The metallic flag
routes the base color into the Fresnel reflectance $F_0$ instead of the diffuse albedo, so a
metal reflects its own color and carries no Lambertian term:

$$
F_0 = \operatorname{lerp}(0.04,\ \text{baseColor},\ \text{metallic})
$$

Roughness controls how tight the highlight is; lower is sharper. In the editor these are the
**Base Color**, **Metallic**, and **Roughness** controls in the Inspector's Material section
(Metallic and Roughness are `0..1` sliders). Read back what you set:

```sh
./cmd/se inspect Mesh        # the Material block shows baseColor, metallic, roughness
```

> [!NOTE]
> Roughness is clamped to `[0.045, 1.0]` in the shader: a true zero collapses the GGX
> denominator into an infinitely sharp highlight. See
> [the Cook-Torrance BRDF](../../explanations/lighting-and-brdf/cook-torrance-brdf/).

## Add a point light to reflect

A metal shows only what it reflects. The directional sun gives one broad highlight; a
nearby point light gives a tight one that moves as you orbit. Place one above and to the
side:

```sh
./cmd/se create-entity Key Light
./cmd/se add-component "Key Light" PointLight
./cmd/se set-transform "Key Light" --translation '{"x":2,"y":3,"z":2}'
./cmd/se set-component "Key Light" PointLight --json '{"intensity":20,"range":15,"color":{"x":1,"y":1,"z":1}}'
```

`set-component` writes the exact JSON shape used in scene files, setting the whole
`PointLightComponent` at once. In the editor: **Create ▸ Point Light**, then edit
**Intensity**, **Range**, and **Color** in the Inspector. Point lights are culled per froxel
by the clustered-forward path, so adding more costs almost nothing per pixel.

Confirm the renderer is feeding lights:

```sh
./cmd/se render-stats        # clustered=on; the fragment loops only its cluster's lights
```

## Tune exposure so the highlight doesn't clip

Lighting is computed in linear HDR, then tonemapped to the display. A bright metal under an
intensity-20 light can blow out to white. The tonemap takes an exposure in stops (EV),
applied as $2^{EV}$ before the curve, so negative EV darkens:

```sh
./cmd/se set-exposure -1.5      # pull the image down 1.5 stops
./cmd/se screenshot viewport /tmp/gold.png
```

Sweep it and compare PNGs: `set-exposure 0` is neutral, `-2` is much darker, `+1` brightens.
Pick the value where the highlight reads as a bright spot rather than a flat white patch.
`render-stats` reports the current `exposureEv`.

> [!NOTE]
> Exposure is a global render setting, not per-material, so there is no Inspector field for
> it — drive it from the CLI. See
> [HDR and exposure](../../explanations/lighting-and-brdf/hdr-and-exposure/).

## Make it glow (optional)

`emissive` adds light the surface emits on its own, independent of any scene light. Give
the mesh a faint emissive tint:

```sh
./cmd/se set-material Mesh --emissive '{"x":0.2,"y":0.1,"z":0}' --emissiveStrength 2
```

Emissive radiance is added after lighting, so it shows even in shadow. In the Inspector it's
**Emissive** (a color) and **Emissive Strength** (a multiplier). Set the strength to 0 to
turn it off.

## Save and next steps

Save the look into your project so it persists:

```sh
./cmd/se save-project /tmp/first-scene/project.json
