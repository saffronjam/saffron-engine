// Phase 15 (bindless slot reclamation): a destroyed GpuTexture returns its bindless slot to a shared
// free-list, which the next upload reuses — so a hot-reloaded / churny scene keeps the pool bounded
// instead of marching nextBindlessIndex to the 1024 limit. new-project clears the asset caches, which
// drops the imported textures' Refs and reclaims their slots; render-stats exposes the counts.
