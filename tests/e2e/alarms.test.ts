// Perf-alarm delivery smoke test (Phase 3). Detectors run each frame and append FIRING/
// RESOLVED events to a non-blocking, seq-cursored ring; the editor drains it alongside the
// usual reconcile poll. This drives a frame-budget breach by tightening the budget so every
// real frame is over it, then relaxes it and checks the matching RESOLVED — exercising the
// fingerprint coalescing, the hysteresis exit, and the never-miss / never-double-count cursor.
