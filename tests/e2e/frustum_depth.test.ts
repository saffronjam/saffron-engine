// Depth-aware camera frustum overlay: the editor draws each CameraComponent's frustum into
// the post-tonemap overlay pass, now depth-tested (read-only) against the scene depth so the
// lines are occluded by geometry instead of painting over it. Binding the scene depth as a
// read-only attachment on the overlay pass — and, under MSAA, resolving the multisampled scene
// depth into the 1x target the overlay reads — are new GPU paths. Assert they stay
// Vulkan-validation-clean in every AA mode (the suite's oracle for sample-count/resolve bugs).
