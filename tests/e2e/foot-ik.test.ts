// Foot IK as a blend-layer producer (Phase 13): a two-bone analytic solver writes into the
// PoseBuffer override_/weight layer so an animated rig's foot plants on a ground plane instead
// of clipping/floating. The leg.gltf fixture is a 3-joint hip→knee→ankle chain whose KneeBend
// clip drops the ankle; with the ground raised, foot IK lifts the ankle back up to track it.
// This drives the whole path over the control plane and asserts the ankle's WORLD Y (read via
// get-world-transform) rises toward the ground target — the "reacts to the environment" result.
// The pose is frozen (playing=false in Play) so the IK-off vs IK-on readings compare one pose.
