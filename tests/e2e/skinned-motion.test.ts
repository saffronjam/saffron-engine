// Skinned motion vectors under TAA: with anti-aliasing set to TAA the motion-vector prepass
// runs, and Phase 8 makes it emit velocity for skinned geometry (a second deformed buffer
// skinned with last frame's palette + per-instance prevModel). This proves the host loop
// drives the animated rig through the motion pass with TAA active and stays validation-clean
// — the path that previously skipped skinned batches (and so ghosted under TAA).
