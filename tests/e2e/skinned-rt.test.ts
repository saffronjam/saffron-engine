// Skinned ray tracing: with hardware ray-query shadows on, an animated rig's BLAS is refit
// every frame from the deformed-vertex buffer (Phase 9) and referenced in the per-frame TLAS
// with an identity transform. This drives the full refit -> TLAS build -> ray-query path with a
// deforming mesh and asserts it stays validation-clean — the AS-build synchronization (skin
// compute write -> AS build read, BLAS build -> TLAS build) is the thing under test. The
// software lavapipe device advertises accelerationStructure + rayQuery, so the path runs here;
// before the deformed buffer carried SHADER_DEVICE_ADDRESS usage this run flagged 20+ VUIDs, so
// a clean log here is a real signal the refit path executed and is correct.
