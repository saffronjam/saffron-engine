# Phase 5 — the rigEditor ViewTab + workspace shell

**Status:** COMPLETED (kept as a build record; superseded by the general Asset editor — see this dir's README)
**Depends on:** 2 (the preview scene), 4 (the subsurface bounds hook)

## Goal

The editor surface: a new `rigEditor` `ViewTab` kind whose workspace shell hosts the live preview.
The engine subsurface is glued into its center pane via phase 4's hook, the preview is entered and
left with the tab, the camera is saved and restored, and the Assets panel routes rigged assets into
it. After this phase you can double-click the leg rig and see it live, orbit it, and watch it
animate. The side panels and timeline are placeholders that phases 6, 7, and 9 fill in.

## What exists to build on

- The ViewTab recipe, with the materialGraph tab as the live precedent: union variant
  (`store.ts:55-66`, materialGraph at `:58`), open action with the dedupe/focus body
  (`openMaterialGraphTab` `store.ts:488-501`; ids namespaced `kind:<resourceId>`), `closeViewTab`
  (`:502-514`), workspace mount gated by `activeKind` (`App.tsx:223-225`) plus the body component
  (`MaterialGraphWorkspace` `App.tsx:282-295`), `tabIcon` branch
  (`WindowTitlebar.tsx:425-444`), re-title sync in `setAssetList` (`store.ts:434-445`), reset in
  `resetSceneState` (`store.ts:645-666`).
- Viewport parking: the `sceneTabActive` effect (`App.tsx:190-197`) parks on any non-scene tab, so
  the rig tab needs the exemption; the `viewportHidden` → `client.setViewportHidden` bridge is
  `:199-205`.
- The open flow: `AssetsPanel` passes `onView={openAssetTab}` (`AssetsPanel.tsx:832`) and the grid
  context-menu equivalent `onViewAsset={openAssetTab}` (`:862`); tiles fire `onView` on double-click
  (`AssetTile.tsx:196`); the single-asset "View" `ContextMenuItem` is `AssetsPanel.tsx:992-995` (the
  batch "View (N)" item at `:965-974`); delete closes tabs by reconstructed id
  `closeViewTab(\`asset:${asset.id}\`)` in `confirmDeleteAssets` (`AssetsPanel.tsx:614`). Nothing
  branches on `AssetEntry.type` today.
- Engine lifecycle: `enter-rig-preview`/`exit-rig-preview` (phase 2 — the camera is stashed and
  restored engine-side, so the editor does not manage it), `get-rig` (phase 1, sourced from the
  `.smodel` container metadata), the serialized control wire + coalescer rule (`editor/AGENTS.md`);
  orbit drives `set-camera` (`control_commands_scene.cpp:1239-1277`, with `get-camera` at `:1235-1237`).
- Shell conventions (`editor/AGENTS.md` + the MaterialGraphEditor structure): `<main>` with
  `min-h-0 flex-1 overflow-hidden bg-background`, toolbar strip `border-b border-border px-3 py-2`,
  `ResizablePanelGroup` splits, semantic tokens only, `notifyError(errorText(err))`, module-level
  cache for tab-switch survival.

## Work

### 1. Store + tab strip — key the tab by the **rig**, not the opened asset

`{ id: string; kind: "rigEditor"; rigMeshId: string; title: string; closable: true }` in the union;
`openRigEditorTab(rigMeshId, title)` with id `rigEditor:<rigMeshId>`. **Tab identity is the resolved
rig (the mesh uuid)**, not the clicked asset, so a mesh and any of its clips open or focus the *same*
tab (the Persona model the README cites: one editor per character), and the one-`previewScene`
engine constraint can never be violated by two tabs of the same rig. **The caller resolves
asset → rig mesh id before opening.** A mesh asset uses its own id. A clip asset's rig is **not** on
its `AssetEntryDto` (the catalog DTO stays lightweight; the clip↔mesh link is intrinsic to the
`.smodel` container, not surfaced on the row — phase 1), so resolve it with a one-shot async
`get-rig { asset: clipId }` (which accepts a clip sub-asset and returns its owning container's
`mesh`, phase 1) and open on the result; a `get-rig` error opens the not-a-rig error state
(phase 10). Same dedupe/focus body as `openMaterialGraphTab`; re-title branch in `setAssetList`
(keyed on the mesh asset's name); `tabIcon` branch (lucide `Bone` or `PersonStanding`); close on
the rig mesh asset's delete alongside the `asset:` id in `confirmDeleteAssets`
(`AssetsPanel.tsx:614`).

### 2. Workspace shell + subsurface

`RigEditorWorkspace { rigMeshId }` mounted at `App.tsx` next to the other workspaces, **keyed
`key={rigMeshId}`** so React remounts it (and runs cleanup) when switching between two different rig
tabs. `activeKind` stays `"rigEditor"` across that switch, so an `activeKind`-only effect would
*not* fire and the engine would keep previewing rig A under rig B's panels. Null-guard "Asset not
found" body. Internal layout: toolbar (asset name, status span, overlay/floor toggles slot) →
horizontal `ResizablePanelGroup`: left panel (skeleton tree placeholder, `defaultSize≈18`), center
**preview pane**, right panel (clips/details placeholder, `≈22`) → bottom timeline placeholder
strip. The preview pane hosts a transparent div (`viewport-host` pattern) consuming
`useSubsurfaceBounds`; all surrounding chrome paints opaque `bg-background`.

### 3. Lifecycle + parking

- Parking: `App.tsx:190` becomes "park unless `sceneTabActive || activeKind === 'rigEditor'`".
- Enter/exit keyed on the **active rig id**, not just `activeKind`: the effect depends on
  `[activeKind, activeRigMeshId]` (or, equivalently, lives in the `key={rigMeshId}` workspace as a
  mount effect with cleanup). On entering a rig tab (scene/other → this rig): `enter-rig-preview
  { asset: rigMeshId }`. On leaving (this rig → non-rig, close, or switch to a different rig):
  `exit-rig-preview`. Switching rig A → rig B is a remount: B's cleanup exits A, B's mount enters B.
  The camera is stashed and restored **inside `enter`/`exit`** (phase 2), so the editor does **not**
  call `get-camera`/`set-camera` for the lifecycle (that was the leak vector). Errors surface as
  toasts; an enter failure (the asset is not a rigged model) renders the workspace error state, and
  the fix is to re-import.
- Orbit input on the preview pane: pointer-drag → coalesced `set-camera` yaw/pitch around the
  framed target; wheel → dolly. This mutates `ctx.sceneEdit.camera`, which `exit-rig-preview`
  restores from its stash, so orbiting never dirties the saved `editorCamera`. Keep it minimal: the
  fly-cam already works, and orbit is the asset-viewer-appropriate model that matches every engine's
  preview.

### 4. Open routing

In the Assets panel's view flow, resolve asset → rig mesh id before opening:
`asset.type === "animation"` → `get-rig { asset: clipId }` then `openRigEditorTab(result.mesh,
rigMeshName)`; a `get-rig` error (the asset is not a rigged model) opens the rig editor's error state.
Mesh assets: full type-aware routing (rigged-mesh double-click → rig
editor) is phase 10 (it needs the persisted `rigged` flag synchronously in the click handler); v1
here adds the context-menu "Open in Rig editor" for mesh assets while double-click keeps the image
viewer.

## Validation (done criteria)

- `bun run check` + `bun run lint` clean; `make engine` untouched or clean.
- Manual (`make run`): double-click the imported leg clip → tab opens, live rig visible on the
  floor with bones, orbit works; switch to Scene tab → viewport re-glues to the dock, authored
  scene intact, camera restored; back → preview re-enters; close tab → exited.
- `make e2e`: the enter/exit lifecycle is already covered headless (phase 2); add a store-level
  test only if the project grows component tests — otherwise the manual matrix above + phase 11's
  full-flow e2e cover it.
- `docs/`: the editor explanation gains the rig-editor tab (open paths, what it shows).

## Notes / gotchas

- **One non-degenerate host at a time** is the invariant (phase 4): the dock host is hidden while
  the rig tab is active, and workspaces unmount on switch; never render the preview host
  `display:none` with a live rect.
- **Tab identity is the rig (mesh uuid), not the asset.** This is why opening a clip and then its
  mesh focuses one tab, and why the single-`previewScene` engine constraint is structurally safe.
  The `key={rigMeshId}` remount is the mechanism that turns a rig-A → rig-B switch into a real
  exit/enter; an `activeKind`-keyed effect would silently keep previewing A.
- The engine resizes its offscreen chain once per tab switch (the rig rect ≠ dock rect): the same
  cost as a dock-split drag end, accepted.
- Respect the revamp constraints (README): internal tab state local, no draggable strips, plain
  `Tabs variant="line"` if the side panels need tabs.
- The preview survives Scene-tab round-trips by *re-entering* (cheap spawn) rather than keeping the
  preview scene alive while the scene tab renders: one stream, one active scene. Keeping it alive
  would render the authored scene anyway.
