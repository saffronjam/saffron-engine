# Tab-system revamp — dockable panel tabs

**Status:** NOT STARTED

Make the editor's panel tabs first-class: one reusable tab-strip component with the *exact*
drag feel of the main view tabs (smaller), and a docking layer so any tool panel can be
dragged between dock areas — e.g. the Material panel tabbed or split beside the Timeline.
Grounded in the tree as of June 2026; line references were verified against `main` at
planning time and may drift.

## Where this starts from

The titlebar's main view tabs (`editor/src/app/WindowTitlebar.tsx`) are the prime example
of the wanted interaction: pointer-capture drag with a 4 px threshold
(`TAB_DRAG_THRESHOLD_PX`, `:22`), a live reorder preview that translates neighbors by the
dragged tab's width (`tabStyle`, `:268-291`), insertion index from snapshotted tab centers
(`insertionIndexForPointer`, `:170-186`), and a WAAPI FLIP settle on drop (`useLayoutEffect`,
`:130-160`). Meanwhile the editor has **three hand-rolled, non-draggable strips** that share
none of it:

- `LeftBottomTabs` (`app/Layout.tsx:254-295`) — Inspector/Environment/Render on Radix `Tabs`.
- `RightSidebar` (`panels/RightSidebar.tsx:28-69`) — Stats/Profiler/Material, closeable, keeps
  inactive panels mounted via `display:none` (`:70-90`) so Material's preview survives.
- `BottomDock` (`panels/BottomDock.tsx:21-62`) — Timeline, closeable, unmounts inactive.

Backing state is three parallel store slices (`state/store.ts`): `bottomTab` (`:43`, `:85`),
`rightTools`/`activeRightTool` (`:46`, `:95-96`), `bottomTools`/`activeBottomTool` (`:50`,
`:99-100`), with two duplicated open/close/activate action trios (`:532-571`) plus the lone
`setBottomTab` (`:394`).

## Requirements (the user's, restated)

1. **A smaller, reusable version of the main tab strip** for panel docks — one component,
   used everywhere.
2. **Panels dock elsewhere by dragging their tab** — concretely: Material can sit together
   with the Timeline, tabbed into the same group *and* side-by-side as a split.
3. **All main-tab drag behavior carries over**: pointer capture, threshold latch, live
   reorder preview, FLIP settle, click-vs-drag activation, close-X fencing.
4. **Dock tabs can never be dropped into the main top bar** (and main tabs never into docks).

## The decision: custom docking layer, no library

Build a thin custom dock system on what the repo already has — the titlebar drag machine,
`react-resizable-panels` v4 (already installed, already persisting splits), and Zustand —
plus one new piece: the portal-into-stable-host pattern for state preservation (phase 05,
dockview's technique hand-rolled, ~70 lines). A three-way design competition
(library / custom / minimal-staged) judged across engineering risk, UX fidelity, and codebase
fit picked custom, executed in the minimal proposal's phase order. The deciding points:

- **Every surveyed library owns the tab strip.** dockview (the best of the field, actively
  maintained, React 19) lets you render the tab *chip* but keeps the strip container, drag
  wiring, and drop ghosts; flexlayout-react moved to HTML5 DnD in 0.8.0; rc-dock is a stalled
  alpha; golden-layout is dormant with no React bindings. Requirement 1+3 — our pointer-capture
  FLIP machine on every strip — would mean replacing, not reusing, the library's core.
- **HTML5 DnD is a liability in our stack.** Tauri intercepts DOM drag events unless
  `dragDropEnabled: false`, and webkit2gtk's in-page HTML5 DnD is broken on Linux/Wayland
  regardless (tauri#6695, #12052, #9725). The titlebar's pointer-capture approach is the
  proven path and avoids the compositor's data-device protocol entirely.
- **The viewport hole rules out casual DOM ownership.** The Viewport panel is a transparent
  hole over a native Wayland subsurface; a library that reparents or re-renders that region on
  its own schedule fights the `emitLayoutSettled` re-glue contract (`app/layoutBus.ts`).

**Plan B, recorded:** if `react-resizable-panels` proves hostile to dynamic tree structure
(phase 01 spike), dockview v6 can serve as the hidden *layout/drop engine* — pointer-events
drag backend (`touchOnly: false`), `renderer: 'always'`, hidden group headers, per-group
`locked`, driven from our own strip via its API. That trades strip ownership friction for
tree management; only take it on a failed spike.

**Ruled out — OS tear-off windows.** Wayland has no toplevel set-position (a detached window
cannot spawn at the cursor), `startDragging()` is a one-way handoff with no completion event
(tauri#4825), cross-window HTML5 DnD is nonfunctional in webkit2gtk, each window is a separate
JS context (no shared Zustand), and the subsurface presenter is bound to the main window. The
model leaves room for in-webview floating panels later (`floating: DockLeaf[]`), deferred.

## Target architecture (summary; details in the phases)

- **`state/dockLayout.ts`** — a pure, DOM-free split tree: `DockBranch` (orientation
  alternating per depth, n-ary children with percent sizes — the VS Code gridview shape) and
  `DockLeaf` (`tabs: DockPanelId[]`, `activeTab`, `locked` for the viewport, `persistent` for
  the interim well-known leaves). Pure mutations (`insertPanel`, `removePanel`, `movePanel`,
  `splitLeaf`, `reorderTab`, `normalize`, `validate`) with bun unit tests — the repo's first
  editor tests.
- **One store slice** (`dockLayout`, `lastLocation`, `openPanel`/`closePanel`/`activatePanel`/
  `movePanel`/`reorderTab`/`setBranchSizes`/`resetDockLayout`) replaces all three tab/tool
  slices. `openPanel` is focus-or-open with an Unreal-style last-location memory.
- **`components/dock/useTabStripDrag.ts` + `TabStrip.tsx`** — the titlebar machine extracted
  verbatim and parameterized; `size: "main" | "dock"` variants; the titlebar itself consumes
  the hook (parity by copy rots).
- **`components/dock/DockPanelsHost.tsx` + `panelRegistry.tsx`** — every open panel renders
  exactly once, flat at app root, portaled into a per-panel host div that leaf bodies claim
  with `appendChild` (dockview's pattern, hand-rolled, ~70 lines). Component state survives
  cross-dock moves; per-panel `renderer: "always" | "onlyWhenVisible"` generalizes
  RightSidebar's keep-mounted policy.
- **`components/dock/dockDrag.ts` + `DockDropOverlay.tsx`** — tear-out past ~one strip height,
  a cursor-following ghost, a drag-scoped rect registry over `[data-dock-leaf]` elements with
  manual hit-testing (`setPointerCapture` retargets events, so targets never see `pointerover`
  — w3c/pointerevents#566), VS Code zone math (strip → insert at index; body center → merge,
  100% overlay; edge thirds → split, 50% overlay).
- **Drag domains hold structurally**, not by runtime check: the titlebar's hook instance has
  no tear-out, the drop registry is built only from `[data-dock-leaf]` (the titlebar never
  carries it), and the id spaces are disjoint types. Requirement 4 is unexpressible to violate.
- **Viewport safety:** the viewport leaf is `locked` (no tab drops, tab not draggable, strip
  hidden); edge splits beside it insert siblings, never occlude. One store subscriber on
  `dockLayout` identity fires `requestAnimationFrame(() => emitLayoutSettled({ force: true }))`
  — no call site can forget the re-glue.
- **Persistence:** one per-project key `saffron.layout.dock:<projectPath>` (style of
  `persistSidebarWidth`, `store.ts:854-881`), validated on load, no-op without a project.

## Phases

Each phase lands green (`cd editor && bun run check`, `make prepare-for-commit`, manual
checklist via `make run`) and leaves a usable tree. No engine changes anywhere in this plan —
no `se` command is owed, `make engine` stays trivially green. Automated coverage is the pure
model (bun tests, phase 03 onward); everything DOM-bound gates on a written manual checklist.

| # | Phase | Delivers |
|---|-------|----------|
| 01 | [Spikes](phase-01-spikes.md) | go/no-go: rrp v4 dynamic structure; WebKitGTK portal reparent, WAAPI, `elementFromPoint` under capture |
| 02 | [Shared tab strip](phase-02-shared-tab-strip.md) | `useTabStripDrag` + `TabStrip`; titlebar retrofitted onto them |
| 03 | [Dock model + store](phase-03-dock-model-and-store.md) | `dockLayout.ts` + tests; one slice replaces three; centralized settle subscriber |
| 04 | [Dock-variant strips](phase-04-dock-variant-strips.md) | the three hand-rolled strips become `TabStrip size="dock"`; in-strip reorder everywhere |
| 05 | [Portal panel host](phase-05-portal-panel-host.md) | `DockPanelsHost` + registry; panels keep state across moves |
| 06 | [Cross-dock drag](phase-06-cross-dock-drag.md) | tear-out, ghost, overlay, tab-merge drops across sites; persistence. **Material tabbed beside Timeline** |
| 07 | [Dock tree render](phase-07-dock-tree-render-swap.md) | `DockRoot` renders the tree; hierarchy/assets/viewport join; Panels menu |
| 08 | [Splits](phase-08-splits.md) | edge-split drops. **Material literally side-by-side with Timeline** |
| 09 | [Polish + docs](phase-09-polish-and-docs.md) | Move-to menu fallback, overflow upgrade, docs page |

## Known behavior changes (accepted)

- Open panels persist per project (today `rightTools`/`bottomTools` are session-only). A
  persisted-open Stats panel resumes metrics polling at launch.
- The hook adds a `lostpointercapture` reset the titlebar today lacks (only
  `onPointerCancel`, `WindowTitlebar.tsx:317`) — accepted hardening, phase 02's one delta.

## Open risks → mitigations

1. **rrp v4 fights dynamic structure** → phase 01 spike before any dependent code; keyed
   remount by structure hash as fallback; dockview-as-engine as plan B.
2. **Portal claim/release race** (host momentarily detached during a React commit) → the
   module map owns host lifetime, release callbacks never destroy hosts; the centralized
   rAF-force settle re-commits viewport bounds; phase 05 gate forces a re-claim.
3. **Viewport re-glue regression** → the settle subscriber lands in phase 03 *together with*
   the migration that retires the old emitters; per-phase manual re-glue checks; over-emitting
   is harmless (debounced end tier in `ViewportPanel`).
4. **WebKitGTK quirks** (WAAPI, `elementFromPoint` under capture) → phase 01 spike; ghost and
   overlay are `pointer-events: none` so hit-testing never self-collides.
5. **Keep-mounted DOM cost** → per-panel `renderer` policy; only Material/Assets pay it.
6. **Mixed-width neighbor-shift inaccuracy** (inherited from the titlebar, more visible in
   compact strips) → bounded by tab min/max widths and the phase-04 shrink guard; per-neighbor
   width refinement is phase-09 polish.
7. **Empty-region reveal targets are novel UX** → drag-scoped only; targets are the
   well-known leaf ids — guaranteed to exist by the `persistent` flags through phase 06,
   then by recreate-on-drop from phase 07 (`movePanel` against a missing well-known leaf
   re-inserts it at its canonical position), so they cannot dangle; review at phase 06.
