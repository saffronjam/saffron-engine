# Phase 21 — Cook-time shader baking

**Status:** COMPLETED — cook command + Slang-module linking done; a shipping asset-bundle is the only open follow-on
**Depends on:** 18

> **Slang-module linking done.** `mesh.slang` is split into `lighting.slang` (a reusable Slang module:
> all bindings/structs + the lighting half exposed as `public evalLighting`/`makeMaterialInput`/
> `transformVertex`/`transformVertexSkinned`) and a thin `mesh.slang` consumer (`import lighting;` +
> `evalSurface` with the `@graph` markers + the three entry points; `kUnlit` stays here as the PSO spec
> constant). CMake compiles `lighting.slang → lighting.slang-module` once and ships the **module** (not the
> source) to the runtime; codegen variants compile only their `evalSurface` + entry points and **link** the
> module (`compileMaterialMeshShader` passes `-I <shaders>`; the source's absence guarantees the link uses
> the precompiled module, not a recompile). This is the "recompile the world" fix: editing lighting rebuilds
> only the module (+ variants relink); editing a material recompiles only its `evalSurface`. Verified
> regression-free — the rendering suite (materials, normal mapping, **skinning**, scene-codegen, preview,
> cook) all pass validation-clean, so the default übershader renders identically through the link.
>
> **Remaining (single open follow-on):** a shipping cook **bundle** — bake variants into a packed asset
> archive keyed by graph hash that the runtime loads without `slangc` (the per-material spv baking +
> module linking are done; this is the packaging step). RT-runtime paths are structurally preserved
> (identical source, relocated) but unverified here — the toolbox GPU is software (no ray tracing).

> **Done (cook command).** `material-cook` (control, `EmptyParams` → `{compiled, failed}`) iterates the
> catalog, and for every material with a **non-foldable** graph compiles its übershader variant to
> `assets/materials/<id>_mesh.spv` (reusing `compileMaterialMeshShader`); foldable/graphless materials are
> skipped. e2e `material_cook.test.ts` proves two procedural materials are compiled and their `.spv`s land
> on disk. This is the precompile/bake direction — run it to warm every variant after a `mesh.slang` change
> or before shipping.
>
> **Remaining:** (1) **Slang-module linking** — split `mesh.slang` so the lighting half is a compiled
> module each variant `import`s, so a material recompiles only its `evalSurface` (not the whole übershader);
> this is the "recompile the world" fix and the make-or-break for shipping. (2) A real **cook pipeline**:
> bake variants into a shipped asset bundle keyed by graph hash, with the runtime loading baked SPIR-V and
> never invoking `slangc`. (3) Hook `material-cook` into the editor's project build / `tools/ci`.

## Goal

Bake every material graph's generated SPIR-V into the project at build/cook time, so a shipped (non-editor)
runtime loads **precompiled** material shaders and never invokes `slangc`. This preserves SaffronEngine's
"no runtime shader compiler at runtime" property — the node-graph's compile cost stays an editor-time
concern, exactly like the engine's hand-written shaders compile in CMake today.

## Why

Phase 18's runtime `slangc` is an editor convenience. A shipped game must not depend on a shader compiler
being present, must start fast, and must avoid first-use compile hitches. UE solves this with a cooked
shader cache; this is the SaffronEngine equivalent, scoped to material graphs.

## Design

- **A cook step** enumerates every material asset's graph, lowers + compiles each to SPIR-V (reusing the
  phase-18 emitter + `slangc`), for each needed permutation (static/skinned × passes), and writes the
  results into the project's asset bundle keyed by graph hash (the same key the runtime PSO cache uses).
- **Runtime load path**: when a material resolves, the renderer looks up the baked SPIR-V by graph hash in
  the bundle; if present (shipped), load it directly into a PSO; the runtime-`slangc` path is compiled out
  (or behind the editor flag from phase 18). Same cache key → editor-compiled and cook-baked are interchangeable.
- **Integration**: a `make cook` / CMake target (and/or a control command `material.bakeAll` the editor can
  trigger before packaging) that walks the catalog and produces the bundle. Re-bake only stale entries
  (hash changed).

## Files to touch

- `engine/source/saffron/` (material compiler) — a `bakeMaterialShaders(project) -> bundle` that compiles all
  graphs to SPIR-V keyed by hash; reuse the phase-18 emitter.
- `engine/source/saffron/rendering/renderer_pipelines.cpp` — the runtime load path prefers baked SPIR-V by
  graph hash; the runtime-compile path is editor-only (compile-time gated).
- `Makefile` / `cmake/` — a `cook`/`bake` target; (optional) a `material.bakeAll` control command.
- `tools/ci/check.sh` — (optional) include a bake smoke for a sample material project.

## Steps

1. `bakeMaterialShaders`: walk the catalog, compile each graph's permutations to SPIR-V, write the bundle
   keyed by graph hash + permutation; skip unchanged hashes.
2. Runtime: load baked SPIR-V by hash; gate the runtime-`slangc` path behind the editor flag.
3. A `make cook` target + (optional) `material.bakeAll` command; bake a sample project.
4. Verify: with the editor compiler disabled, a baked project renders all materials (no `slangc` invoked).

## Gate / done

- `make engine` clean; a cooked project renders all node-graph materials with the runtime compiler disabled
  (assert `slangc` is never spawned at runtime).
- Re-bake skips unchanged graphs. `make prepare-for-commit` clean. Docs: the cook/bake pipeline.

## Risks

- **Permutation coverage**: the cook must bake every permutation the runtime can request (static/skinned ×
  passes) or a shipped build hits a missing-shader path. Enumerate from the same key space as the runtime cache.
- **Bundle staleness**: key strictly on graph content hash; a mismatch silently loads the wrong shader.
  Make the runtime assert the loaded hash matches the requested one.
- **Determinism**: `slangc` output should be stable for a given input; pin the Slang version (the toolbox
  pins it) so cooked hashes are reproducible.
