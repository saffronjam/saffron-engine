# Phase 2: Serialize parent by uuid, two-pass resolve, SceneVersion 3 migration

**Status:** NOT STARTED

<!-- Flip to COMPLETED when the Done-when checklist passes validation-clean (selftest + e2e + contract test). Delete this file only after COMPLETED + merged. -->

## Goal

Make parenting durable. `RelationshipComponent` (added in phase 1) currently lives only at
runtime — `createEntity` emplaces a default `{parent:0}`, `relinkHierarchy` rebuilds the
caches, but nothing writes the parent uuid to disk or reads it back. This phase:

- Registers `RelationshipComponent` in `registerBuiltinComponents` so `serializeEntity` /
  `deserializeEntity` round-trip it, emitting **only** the durable parent `Uuid`.
- Bumps `SceneVersion` 2 → 3 and extends the version-history comment + the upper-bound check.
- Turns the dormant `uuidToHandle` resolve hook in `sceneFromJson` into the two-pass
  parent-resolution + children-rebuild pass.
- Migrates v1/v2 scenes (no `RelationshipComponent` on disk ⇒ every entity defaults to root).
- Relinks the hierarchy after `copy-entity` so a duplicate appears in its source's children.

It depends on phase 1 (the `RelationshipComponent` struct, `relinkHierarchy(Scene&)`,
`setParent`, recursive `destroyEntity`, and the world-transform pass). It does **not** touch
the wire/editor — that is phase 3 (`list-entities` parentId, `set-parent`, the React tree).

## Current state

Grounded anchors (current line numbers):

- `SceneVersion = 2` — `engine/source/saffron/scene/scene.cppm:425`. Version-history comment
  at `:423` ("1 = entities only; 2 = adds the top-level environment block").
- `sceneFromJson` upper-bound check rejects `version > SceneVersion` —
  `engine/source/saffron/scene/scene.cppm:579`.
- The two-pass loader: create-preserving-uuid + `deserializeEntity` loop at
  `engine/source/saffron/scene/scene.cppm:596-620`; the `uuidToHandle` map built at `:592`
  with `emplace` at `:609`.
- The dormant resolve hook — `static_cast<void>(uuidToHandle);` with the "hook is ready for
  them" comment — `engine/source/saffron/scene/scene.cppm:622-624`. This is exactly where
  parent-uuid → live-handle resolution belongs.
- `serializeEntity` skips storages with no registered `ComponentTraits` (e.g. `IdComponent`,
  the unregistered `WorldTransformComponent`) — `engine/source/saffron/scene/scene.cppm:514`,
  skip comment at `:526`. So `RelationshipComponent` only round-trips once registered.
- `registerBuiltinComponents` registers Name, Transform, Mesh, Camera, Material,
  DirectionalLight, PointLight, SpotLight — `engine/source/saffron/sceneedit/scene_edit_components.cpp:17`.
  The uuid-by-reference pattern to copy is `MeshComponent` at `:46-54`
  (`toJson { mesh: uuidToJson(c.mesh.value) }`, `fromJson Uuid{ jsonU64Or(j,"mesh",0) }`).
  The last block (`SpotLight`) ends at `:132-151`.
- `copy-entity` deep-duplicates by looping `ctx.sceneEdit.registry.rows` and
  `deserialize(serialize(...))` per present component —
  `engine/source/saffron/control/control_commands_scene.cpp:533`, loop at `:545-551`,
  `sceneVersion += 1` at `:553`.
- `runSceneSerializationSelfTest` round-trips a hand-built scene —
  `engine/source/saffron/scene/scene.cppm:663` (registers Name + Transform inline).
- `RelationshipComponent { Uuid parent; entt::entity parentHandle; std::vector<entt::entity>
  children; }`, `createEntity` default emplace, and `relinkHierarchy(Scene&)` are phase-1
  deliverables in `engine/source/saffron/scene/scene.cppm` (near `TransformComponent` ~`:43`
  and `destroyEntity` ~`:281`). Only `parent` is durable; `parentHandle` / `children` are
  runtime caches that must never be serialized or value-copied.

## Implementation

### 1. Register `RelationshipComponent` (serialize the parent uuid only)

Add a `registerComponent<RelationshipComponent>` block at the end of
`registerBuiltinComponents` (`engine/source/saffron/sceneedit/scene_edit_components.cpp`,
after the `SpotLight` block at `:132-151`), following the `MeshComponent` uuid pattern at
`:46`:

```cpp
registerComponent<RelationshipComponent>(reg, "Relationship",
    [](Scene&, Entity) {},
    [](const RelationshipComponent& c) -> nlohmann::json {
        return nlohmann::json{ { "parent", uuidToJson(c.parent.value) } };
    },
    [](RelationshipComponent& c, const nlohmann::json& j) -> Result<void> {
        c.parent = Uuid{ jsonU64Or(j, "parent", 0) };
        // parentHandle / children stay default — caches, rebuilt by the resolve pass.
        return {};
    },
    false);   // non-removable: parenting is edited via set-parent / the tree, not as a raw field
```

- `toJson` emits **only** `{ "parent": uuidToJson(c.parent.value) }` — never `parentHandle`
  or `children` (live `entt::entity` handles are not stable across load and `copyTo`
  (`scene.cppm:465`) value-copies the component, so a serialized children vector would alias
  or emit non-portable ids).
- `fromJson` reads **only** the parent uuid; the caches stay default and are rebuilt by the
  resolve pass (§3) / `relinkHierarchy`.
- `removable = false`. Phase-3 editor work must filter it out of the Inspector's removable set
  (like the existing `NON_REMOVABLE` filter) so parenting is not edited as a raw uuid field;
  note that here so the contract test's `inspect` validation accounts for the new component.

`uuidToJson` / `jsonU64Or` are the same helpers `MeshComponent` uses (`scene.cppm`), so a
parent uuid serializes as a bare non-negative integer in the file (string in TS once phase 3
puts it on the wire).

### 2. Bump `SceneVersion` 2 → 3

In `engine/source/saffron/scene/scene.cppm`:

- `:425` — `inline constexpr int SceneVersion = 3;`.
- `:423` — extend the version-history comment: "… 2 = adds the top-level environment block;
  3 = adds a per-entity Relationship component (durable parent uuid). A v1/v2 document has no
  Relationship; the loader defaults every entity to root."
- `:579` — the upper-bound check `version > SceneVersion` now admits 3; no logic change, the
  bumped constant does the work. v1/v2 still load (lower bound stays `version < 1`), and the
  missing-relationship migration in §3 keeps them clean.

### 3. Two-pass parent resolve (replace the dormant hook)

Replace `static_cast<void>(uuidToHandle);` at `engine/source/saffron/scene/scene.cppm:624`
(after the create+deserialize loop at `:596-620`) with the resolve pass. The loop must stay
two-pass: `sceneToJson` emits entities in `forEach<IdComponent>` order (`:561`), which is
arbitrary, so a child's parent uuid may appear *after* the child in the array — resolution
runs only after all entities + uuids exist.

```cpp
// Resolve parent uuids to live handles and rebuild the children caches.
// (relinkHierarchy specialized to the loader's uuidToHandle map.)
forEach<RelationshipComponent>(scene, [&](Entity e, RelationshipComponent& rel) {
    if (rel.parent.value == 0) {
        rel.parentHandle = entt::null;   // explicit root
        return;
    }
    auto it = uuidToHandle.find(rel.parent.value);
    if (it == uuidToHandle.end()) {
        logWarn(std::format("entity {} references missing parent uuid {}; treating as root",
                            getComponent<IdComponent>(scene, e).id.value, rel.parent.value));
        rel.parent = Uuid{ 0 };
        rel.parentHandle = entt::null;
        return;
    }
    rel.parentHandle = it->second;
    getComponent<RelationshipComponent>(scene, Entity{ it->second }).children.push_back(e.handle);
});
```

Notes:

- **v1/v2 migration.** A pre-v3 document has no `Relationship` key, so `deserializeEntity`
  never touches it. But every entity created in the loop at `:607` only gets an `IdComponent`
  emplaced by hand — `deserializeEntity` add-defaults a component **only** when its JSON key is
  present. So after the loop, walk all entities and ensure a default `RelationshipComponent`
  exists before the resolve pass (use `addComponent<RelationshipComponent>` /
  `addDefault` if missing, or iterate `uuidToHandle` and emplace where absent). With a default
  `{parent:0}` every legacy entity resolves to root in the pass above. Equivalent and simpler:
  call the phase-1 `relinkHierarchy(scene)` here instead of the inline pass, provided
  `relinkHierarchy` (a) tolerates entities lacking the component by defaulting them to root and
  (b) `logWarn`s dangling parents. Pick one; the inline pass is shown for grounding, but
  reusing `relinkHierarchy` keeps a single resolve implementation. **Decide and document which.**
- **Dangling parent** (uuid not in `uuidToHandle`) ⇒ root + `logWarn`, never a crash. Reset
  `rel.parent` to 0 so the in-memory state matches "root" and a subsequent save does not
  re-emit the dead uuid.
- **`forEach` is unordered** — fine here: this pass touches each entity once and only writes
  its own `parentHandle` + pushes into its parent's `children`; order does not matter because
  all handles already exist.

### 4. Relink after `copy-entity`

In `engine/source/saffron/control/control_commands_scene.cpp`, after the deep-copy loop at
`:545-551` (which `deserialize(serialize(...))`s each present component into `fresh`,
duplicating the source's `RelationshipComponent.parent` uuid — correct: the copy joins the
source's parent), call `relinkHierarchy(scene)` before the `sceneVersion += 1` at `:553`:

```cpp
getComponent<NameComponent>(scene, fresh).name = copyName;
relinkHierarchy(scene);            // register the copy in its parent's children + resolve handles
ctx.sceneEdit.sceneVersion += 1;
```

Rationale: the value-copy at `copyTo` (`scene.cppm:465`) duplicates the `parent` uuid safely
(children/parentHandle are non-serialized, so the loop's `serialize`/`deserialize` never
touches live handles), but without `relinkHierarchy` the new entity's `parentHandle` /
membership in its parent's `children` vector are stale — the copy is invisible to its parent.
v1 is single-entity copy (no subtree recursion); the copy is a sibling of the source under the
same parent.

## Done when

- [ ] `RelationshipComponent` is registered in `registerBuiltinComponents`
  (`scene_edit_components.cpp`), `removable=false`, serializing only `{ "parent": <uuid> }`.
- [ ] `SceneVersion == 3`; the version-history comment (`scene.cppm:423`) and the upper-bound
  check (`:579`) reflect v3; v1/v2 documents still load.
- [ ] Round-trip: build a two-entity scene where child's `RelationshipComponent.parent` is the
  parent's uuid, `writeScene` then `readScene` (or `sceneToJson`/`sceneFromJson`); after load
  the child's `parentHandle` resolves and it appears in the parent's `children` — checked by an
  added case in `runSceneSerializationSelfTest` (`scene.cppm:663`) or a `tests/e2e` round-trip
  via save/load over the control plane.
- [ ] **Order-independent:** a scene file whose child entry precedes its parent entry in the
  `entities` array still resolves (the two-pass loader handles it) — assert in the selftest by
  emitting the child first.
- [ ] **v2 migration:** loading a v2 scene (no `Relationship` key anywhere) succeeds with every
  entity defaulting to root (`parent == 0`, `parentHandle == entt::null`) — e2e load of a
  fixture v2 scene, validation-clean, no warnings.
- [ ] **Dangling parent:** a scene whose child references a parent uuid not in the file loads
  the child as a root with a single `logWarn`, not a crash — selftest/e2e assertion.
- [ ] `se copy-entity <parent-or-child>` followed by `se inspect <copy>` shows the copy
  carrying the source's parent uuid, and the copy is present in its parent's children (verified
  after the phase-3 `list-entities parentId` lands; until then, assert via the round-trip that
  the copied parent uuid survives a save/load).
- [ ] `tools/ci/check.sh` (engine build → present-only smoke → control-schema contract test →
  frontend build) and `make e2e` run validation-clean.

## Risks / seams

- **Two-pass is essential.** `sceneToJson`'s `forEach<IdComponent>` (`scene.cppm:561`) emits
  entities in arbitrary order; the resolve must run after the full create+deserialize loop, on
  the complete `uuidToHandle` map. Folding resolution into the per-entity loop would fail on a
  forward reference.
- **Durable surface is the uuid only.** Serialize/copy `parent` (a `Uuid`); never an
  `entt::entity` handle (`parentHandle`) or the `children` vector — entt ids are not stable
  across load and `copyTo` value-copies the component. The §1 `toJson`/`fromJson` touching only
  `parent` is the load-bearing safety choice; do not widen it.
- **Migration must default missing relationships.** `deserializeEntity` only add-defaults a
  component whose JSON key is present, so legacy entities have no `RelationshipComponent` after
  the loop unless explicitly ensured. Missing this leaves entities the resolve pass / world
  pass cannot address. Reusing `relinkHierarchy` (which must tolerate + default missing) is the
  least-duplicated path; confirm phase 1's `relinkHierarchy` defaults rather than asserts.
- **`copy-entity` relink ordering.** `relinkHierarchy` must run after the component loop and
  the name fixup but before/at the `sceneVersion` bump, or the copy is orphaned from its
  parent's `children`. Single-entity copy only (no subtree); a subtree copy that remints child
  uuids is out of scope for this phase.
- **Selftest/contract scope.** `runSceneSerializationSelfTest` registers components inline; the
  new round-trip case must register `RelationshipComponent` the same way (or call
  `registerBuiltinComponents`). The contract test (`tools/check-control-schema`) will see the
  new component via `inspect`/`dump-schema` once registered — phase 3 owns the matching
  `relationship` schema, but this phase must not make the existing contract test fail (the new
  component appears in `inspect` output, which is `additionalProperties`-validated per known
  component schemas; coordinate the schema add with phase 3 if the contract test runs against a
  parented scene before then).
